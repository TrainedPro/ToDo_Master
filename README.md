# Master Application

Please don't get confused, this is NOT an ANDROID Application!
This is a simple c++ program that will take information from you and will save your info in the form of tasks.You can also make changes to your tasks like updating or deleting. 

Welcome to the Master Application project! This application is designed to help users effectively manage their tasks. It provides a range of features to streamline task organization and improve productivity.


## Features
The Master Application currently includes the following features:

1. Adding Tasks: The application successfully allows users to add new tasks to their task list. This feature enables users to input task details, such as title, description and due date.
2. Marking Tasks as Complete: Users can mark tasks as complete once they finish working on them. This functionality provides a clear indication of completed tasks and helps users track their progress.
3. Deleting Tasks: Tasks that are no longer relevant or completed can be deleted from the task list. This feature provides a convenient way to manage and declutter the task collection.
4. Sorting Tasks: The implemented sorting feature allows users to sort tasks based on specific criteria, such as ID, due date, date added or even title. This enables users to organize their tasks in a way that suits their preferences and workflow.
5. Strike-through: Users can utilize the strike-through functionality to visually mark tasks as completed. This feature enhances task visibility and assists in distinguishing between completed and pending tasks.
6. Multiple Users: The application allows multiple users to create individual accounts and manage their tasks separately. Each user can access their own task list and make changes without interfering with other users' data.
7. Safe File Management: If the program is interrupted, all the changes will be reverted to the last save. This is done by creating a temporary file and only making it permanent after the changes are successfully implemented
8. File Exception Handling: Managing most errors such as a file not being read have been accounted for in this project.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Master Application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone [ToDo Master](https://github.com/TrainedPro/ToDo_Master/edit/main/README.md)
2. Compile and run the `main.cpp` file.

## Usage

After running the file, a menu will appear. You can use it through the already available options and either create a new file or use the old one.

You can further go for a TaskList which is:
- A simple tasklist for simpler tasks.
- You can have 1 main task with a description for that task.

Or a DetailedTaskList which is:
- For complex tasks with multiple steps.
- You can have 1 main task with multiple subtasks or steps for each task.
- Subtasks will automatically be managed alongside tasks.
